Preprint use and acceptance vary widely between disciplines. We will cover some key preprint servers, practices and help you to find out more information relevant to your research area and preferred journals. 

## Understanding journal policies/permissions

Consider the following points:

- Will posting a preprint affect publishing in other journals? [Click here to check Sherpa/Romeo website for journal policies](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/)
- Examples of relevant journals in your field that do/don’t allow preprints (most do!)
- Citing preprints - may be relevant as some journals don’t allow this

Funder policies
Be aware of what your funder requires (e.g., some funder policies encourage or mandate preprints in the case of global health emergencies). Giving specific concrete examples helps people take it seriously - don’t just mention “check your funder”!
