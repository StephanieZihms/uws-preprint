title: Introduction to preprints
teaching: 15
exercises: 30
duration: null
summary: An introduction to preprints, highlighting their benefits and
  addressing concerns.
questions:
  - What are preprints?
  - What are the benefits of posting preprints?
  - What concerns might researchers have about posting preprints?
objectives:
  - Learn what preprints are
  - Understand how preprints can benefit science and individual researchers
  - Understand the concerns surrounding preprints and how to mitigate them
keypoints:
  - A preprint is an early version of a scholarly article that has not
    necessarily undergone peer review.
  - Preprints benefit science by getting your work out there as soon as it's
    ready, to reduce delays in knowledge sharing
  - Preprints are a free way to publish open access

# Welcome to the UWS Preprint workshop
This workshop will be delivered over two days 

Day 1:

Day 2: 

## What are preprints?

A preprint is a version of a scientific manuscript posted on a public server prior to formal peer review. As soon as it’s posted, your preprint becomes a permanent part of the scientific record, citable with its own unique DOI. By sharing early, you can accelerate the speed at which science moves forward.

## Benefits of preprints

- We see preprints as an important step toward a more open and transparent peer review process — one with tremendous benefits for both individual authors and the broader scientific community.
- Preprints allow you to share your results when you’re ready — whether you’re researching an emergent disaster, applying for a grant, or just excited to broadcast your work to a wider audience.
- It’s common for researchers to achieve a similar advance at around the same time but the publication process can artificially delay one paper or favor another. Posting preprints allows researchers to publicly date stamp their discoveries.
- The sooner research becomes available, the sooner it can begin to receive views and citations. In this case, common sense is backed up by evidence. Research shows that public posting increases the number of times papers are viewed and cited.
- Preprints enable you to showcase your latest work for grant, hiring, or tenure committees. A link to a publicly posted preprint is more illustrative and compelling than a title on a CV with the annotation “in development” or “under review.”
- Preliminary feedback helps authors improve manuscripts. Collegial discussion can lead to new ideas, follow-up studies, or collaborations with other research groups. Plus, you can cite your preprint in your letters of inquiry.
- From the moment a preprint appears online to the day that the article is published in a peer reviewed journal, you can make as many updates as you want or need. Each version is numbered and incorporated into the preprint record.

## Preprint concerns

Importantly, you might have some concerns about sharing your research findings and ideas as a preprint. Common concerns (and how to address them) may include:

- The dangers of having non-peer reviewed studies in public view (and how to mitigate that)
- Having multiple versions of a paper out there (and how to link back to the final published version)

It’s okay to be concerned about these topics, and this workshop will cover these topics and provide you with some solutions.
